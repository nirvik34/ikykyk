# **iykyk Android Internship Assignment**

**Video-based unique-person collage**

## **What to build**

Build an Android app that processes the supplied portrait videos on-device, detects faces, identifies the same person across separate appearances, chooses a strong representative shot for each person, and creates a collage that can be saved and shared.

## **Requirements**

> * Process any similar portrait video; the three supplied clips are the test set, so do not hardcode their results.  
> * Load the selected video and show clear processing progress.  
> * Keep processing off the main thread so the app stays responsive.  
> * Live camera recording is not required and will not be evaluated.  
> * Use face detection, face embeddings, and clustering to group appearances of the same person. All three stages are required.  
> * Show each person's appearance count. Create one collage for each video, with every person detected in that video shown exactly once.  
> * Choose a representative shot for each person. Judge each candidate shot using face attributes such as frontality (how front-facing the head pose is), sharpness (in focus, not motion-blurred), eyes open, and smiling / expression probability — favouring frontal, crisp, eyes-open, pleasant shots. Prefer a source frame where the full face is visible; avoid clipped faces and closed eyes where possible.  
> * Create a good-looking, presentable, shareable collage. Be creative; a popular Instagram Story collage format is a useful reference.  
> * Do not crop tightly to the detected face bounding box: it produces low-resolution, poor-quality tiles. Use the full frame, or crop generously around the face.  
> * Let the user save the collage to the gallery and share it through the standard Android share sheet.

## **Stack and constraints**

> * Kotlin, minSdk 26\. Compose or XML is your choice.  
> * ML Kit is encouraged for face detection. Use an on-device embedding model and document it in the README.  
> * Everything must run on-device. There is no backend.  
> * Time-box the assignment to 12-15 hours across the four days. Prioritise a working end-to-end flow.

## **Test videos**

Use all three 30-second portrait clips: [Sample 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TjmQ2tYiQFGRgbQiAYKPX_sDCdPFP1gJ/view) · [Sample 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tb393FemrCkNYC5Pj3TdeddBgG-az3Hs/view) · [Sample 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WEc-WlyF7dYF9F_tOcOX8HiAILYWH_1L/view) · [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IzlZXv5YIO1-62Dh8NJibfJPCAYGVrzq)

## **How counting works**

An appearance is one continuous visible segment: it starts when a person's face becomes clearly visible and ends when it is no longer clearly visible. Blurred whip-pan passes count for nobody. Two clearly visible people in one segment count as one appearance each.

Sample 1 worked example: five distinct people, each appearing four times, for 20 appearances total. A and B share the frame at 10.1-11.5s; C and D share it at 20.2-21.6s. Test on Samples 2 and 3 too; their counts are not provided.

## **How you'll be judged**

> * Identity grouping and appearance-count accuracy: 50%  
> * Code quality and architecture: 30%  
> * App usability, representative-shot quality, and collage presentation: 20%

## **Submit by**

Sunday, 6 September 2026, 11:59 PM IST. Nothing will be accepted after the deadline.

Submit here: Git repository; README with build/setup steps, embedding model used, and similarity threshold chosen; working debug APK; and a plain screen recording of the end-to-end flow, up to 60 seconds. No narration or editing is required: show processing, appearance counts, and the finished collage. The recording must clearly show the generated collage for each of the three sample videos, on screen and legible; hold on each long enough to review.

Make sure the collage output is visible in your demo video.
